# Adventure of Sound

An interactive sound game.

## Setup

Before start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also recommend using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as package manager, but this is optional.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaKoala/adventure-of-sound.git
cd adventure-of-sound
npm install
```

### Locally develop with Hot Module Reload
